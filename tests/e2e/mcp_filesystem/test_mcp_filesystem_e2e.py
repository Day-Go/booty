"""
End-to-end tests for MCP Filesystem functionality.

These tests simulate a conversation with an agent that uses MCP commands
to interact with the filesystem. The tests verify that:
1. The XML parser correctly identifies MCP commands
2. The MCP command handler correctly processes these commands
3. The filesystem operations work as expected
4. Agent continuation works after executing commands

2. **get_user_by_id(user_id)**: Retrieves a specific user by their ID
3. **create_user(data)**: Creates a new user with the provided data

The class interacts with the database through the `get_db_session()` function imported from the database connection module. It follows a service layer pattern, separating business logic from the database models and API routes.

Based on the code I've shown you, this project uses SQLAlchemy as its ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool. Here's a summary of the database models:

1. **User Model**:
   - Primary fields: id, username, email, password_hash, created_at, is_active, last_login
   - Has a one-to-many relationship with Posts (one user can have many posts)

2. **Post Model**:
   - Primary fields: id, title, content, author_id, created_at, updated_at
   - Has a many-to-one relationship with Users (many posts can belong to one user)
   - Has a many-to-many relationship with Tags through the post_tags table

3. **Tag Model**:
   - Primary fields: id, name
   - Has a many-to-many relationship with Posts through the post_tags table

The database connection is managed through the `get_db_connection()` and `get_db_session()` functions. The connection can be configured using environment variables, with a default SQLite database fallback.

Would you like me to explain the relationships between these models in more detail or look at how they're used in the application?""".format(mock_project_path=mock_project_path)

            {
                "user": "How do I run the tests for this project?",
                "agent": """I'll help you understand how to run the tests for this project. Let's first check what's in the tests directory:

<mcp:filesystem>
    <list path="{mock_project_path}/tests" />
</mcp:filesystem>

Let's also check if there's a conftest.py file, which is often used for pytest fixtures:

<mcp:filesystem>
    <read path="{mock_project_path}/tests/conftest.py" />
</mcp:filesystem>

Now, let's examine one of the test files to understand what's being tested:

<mcp:filesystem>
    <read path="{mock_project_path}/tests/test_user_service.py" />
</mcp:filesystem>

Let's also check the requirements.txt file to confirm the testing framework:

<mcp:filesystem>
    <grep path="{mock_project_path}/requirements.txt" pattern="pytest" />
</mcp:filesystem>

Based on my analysis, this project uses pytest as its testing framework. To run the tests, you would:

1. Make sure you have the dependencies installed:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the tests using pytest:
   ```
   pytest tests/
   ```

You can also run specific test files:
   ```
   pytest tests/test_user_service.py
   ```

Or specific test functions:
   ```
   pytest tests/test_user_service.py::test_get_all_users
   ```

The conftest.py file sets up a test database with pre-populated data for testing. It creates an in-memory SQLite database for testing purposes, so your tests won't affect any production data.

Would you like me to explain the test fixtures or any specific test case in more detail?""".format(mock_project_path=mock_project_path)
