- [ ] Add command line arg for launching agent in debug mode

### Scoped

#### HIGH Priority
- [ ] This class is a mess. Hardcoded rules that aren't useful. Summarising the wikipedia page of a book would be considered a complex task Writing an advanced GPU algorithm would be considered trivial w/ no required planning This needs to be replaced with a lightweight model that decomposes tasks [src/task_planner.py:10-14]

#### LOW Priority
- [ ] Extend behaviour to capture other sets of mcp commands, i.e. mcp:browser. [src/xml_parser.py:66]
