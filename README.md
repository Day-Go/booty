### Booty Coding Agent

Booty is an experiment to see how far we can get in building a CLI coding agent, using Claude Code. As of the 17th commit, the project has cost $32 USD and processed more than 69 million input tokens & 681k output tokens. The goal is to get an end product as close to Claude Code as possible.

Throughout the project I'll be periodically reviewing and modifying code. Claude Code is fantastic, but I am starting to see the limitations of the context window already. For a while Claude could load most of the project into context which meant very few bugs and successful implementations of my requests. Now, regression and bugs are creeping in due to context being missed.
