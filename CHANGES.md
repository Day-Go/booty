### MCP Filesystem Update
- Updated MCPFilesystemClient in ollama_inference_offline.py to match implementation in mcp_filesystem_client.py
- Added XML command parsing capabilities to OfflineFileAgent, matching mcp_command_handler.py
- Improved error handling and formatting of command results
- Added support for all MCP filesystem commands (read, write, list, search, cd, pwd, grep, mkdir)
- Fixed critical TODO item: "The contents of this folder is out of date and no longer reflects how the filesystem mcp commands are formatter, and how the server/clients are implemented"
